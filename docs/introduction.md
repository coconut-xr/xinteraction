## **xinteraction** Concept

**xinteraction** provides the means to integrate different input devices, such as WebXR Controllers and a mouse, consistently into a 3D scene. **xinteraction** provides a simple interface to the input devices and translates their events into objects in a Three.js scene.

**xinteraction** allows to define how an object reacts to interaction independently from the specific input device. For instance, when building the logic for dragging a 3D cube, **xinteraction** allows to use familiar functionality such as `setPointerCapture,` and familiar events such as `onPointerDown` and `onPointerUp` to describe the dragging behavior. As a result, the cube is draggable using a mouse, touch controls, 6DOF Controllers, Hands, and all other input devices added to the scene.

**xinteraction** provides only very primitive input devices, which can be composed for more complex interactions, like touch interaction using the index finger of WebXR Hands. For more high-level WebXR input devices, visit [TBD]().

## Getting Started

In the following tutorials, we will introduce how to add input devices and interactive objects to a scene in react using react-three/fiber. To follow along in your own development environment install the dependencies via `npm i @coconut-xr/xinteraction @react-three/fiber react react-dom three` or use the CodeSandbox provided for each example.

## Mouse and Touch Interaction

At first, we will remove the default event handling of @react-three/fiber by settings the `event` property of the `<Canvas/>` component to `noEvent` from `xinteraction/react`. To re-enable interaction via the mouse and touch, we will add corresponding **xinteraction** input devices. We provide the `XWebPointers` component, which automatically creates an input device for the mouse and one for each touch pointer. With these 2 changes, we already enabled the scene to handle multiple input devices and multi-touch. Events will be delivered to the objects and can be captured via `onPointerDown`, `onClick`, etc.

The following code shows a `Box`, which decreases its opacity when more input devices (e.g., fingers on a touch screen) are over it.


#### Important:

For correct touch handling, the css property `touch-action: none` must be set on the canvas or on any parent element.

```tsx
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { XWebPointers, noEvents } from "@coconut-xr/xinteraction/react";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas style={{ touchAction: "none" }} events={noEvents}>
      <Box />
      <XWebPointers />
    </Canvas>
  );
}

function Box() {
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState<Array<number>>([]);
  return (
    <mesh
      onPointerEnter={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        setHovered((c) => [...c, e.pointerId]);
      }}
      onPointerLeave={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        setHovered((c) => c.filter((id) => id != e.pointerId));
      }}
    >
      <boxGeometry />
      <meshBasicMaterial
        color="red"
        opacity={1 - hovered.length * 0.3}
        transparent
        toneMapped={false}
      />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

When developing with multiple `xinteraction` for multiple input devices, ensure that you keep track of what input device or how many input devices hovered your object. A simple boolean state for hover effects is often not enough with more than one input device. It is also important to note that `onPointerEnter` events will always be followed by an `onPointerLeave` eventually. However, not all `onPointerDown` will be followed by an `onPointerUp` and vice versa. For instance, you can drag your mouse into an object while pressing a button. Releasing the button inside the object causes an `onPointerUp` event without ever issuing an `onPointerDown` event. This is not the case for distance-based input devices, which always receive an `onPointerDown` event before the `onPointerUp` event.

Multi-touch support is nice, but that's not what we are here for. In the next section, we introduce how to create **arbitrary pointers** that can, for instance, be attached to XRControllers.
